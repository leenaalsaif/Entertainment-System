# Entertainment System Project

## Introduction
Many of us have free time on the weekends and want to watch a movie, whether we want to watch it alone or with our family. However, movies have something called The Rating System. Based on that, we made a program to demonstrate to the user a collection of movies and TV shows and books that are suitable for their age. 

## About "Entertainment System"
In our project, we made a program called “Entertainment System” and what our program does is that it lets the user access the program, by entering your name, age and email. Then the program will display a collection of movies, TV shows, and books based on your age and you can choose whatever you want depending on your age.
